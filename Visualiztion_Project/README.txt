# Bank Campaign Data

## Dataset
This is the classic marketing bank dataset uploaded originally in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset gives you information about a marketing campaign of a financial institution in which you will have to analyze in order to find ways to look for future strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank.
The dataset and information about variables can be found in kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-campaign-opening-a-term-deposit/data


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found out that some variables do have influence on
whether a client subscribes to term deposit or not. These results can be 
used to optimize future campaigns and make them more personalized and 
effecient in targeting.
The job of the client was found to have positive influence if the client is
a student or retired. However, it has negative influence if the client 
works as blue-collar or in services.
Married people are less likely to subscribe to term deposits.
People who have housing loans are also less likely to subscribe.
People contacted via cellular were found more likely to subscribe.
People who are aged less than 35 and more than 60 are more potential 
subscribers to term deposits than the rest.
Higher balance in the client's account means he is a potential candidate.
Clients should be contacted less often, and if the duration of these contacts
increases; it means clients are more likely to subscribe.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For this presentation, I tried multiple variations to find out the pattern 
between variables and the effect of client's data on his/her behavior.
I start by showing the effect of catigorical variables on the response
for deposit. These variables are Job, Marital Status, House Loans and 
Device used.
Then we explain the effect of numerical variables on whether the client
chooses to deposit or not. I showed the effect of Age, Balance, Duration 
and Contacts made per campaign. I have made sure to polish my visualizations
and follow coloring codes to make visualizations as simple and clear as possible.
